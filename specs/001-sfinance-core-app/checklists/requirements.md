## Notes

- Updated 2026-04-18: Incorporated open-ended subscriptions ("Sin fecha de fin" toggle) into FR-003, FR-008, FR-012b, SC-004, and Edge Cases section.
- FR-008 now distinguishes Financiación (endDate always mandatory) from Suscripción (endDate optional via toggle); payDay selector requirement added for Suscripción.
- RecurringTemplate Key Entity description still references "end date (user-selected future date)" — for open-ended subscriptions endDate is null. This is a minor inconsistency to address in the next planning pass if needed.
